- Primary color: HSL values of 210, 70%, 50%â€”a bright but grounded blue (#3399E6) evoking trust and reliability in civic engagement.
- Background color: Light desaturated blue (HSL 210, 20%, 95% - #F0F8FF) for a clean, accessible user experience.
- Accent color: A contrasting orange-yellow (HSL 180, 90%, 40% - #33CCCC) used for CTAs and to highlight key interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a sans-serif for a tech-forward feel. Body text: 'Inter' sans-serif. Pairing these gives a balance of modernity and readability.
- If computer code is displayed: Use 'Source Code Pro', which is monospaced, for any code snippets (like the structure of API calls).
- Use clear, intuitive icons related to each issue category (e.g., road, sanitation) to enhance usability.
- Maintain a clean and organized layout, with clear hierarchy and easy navigation.
